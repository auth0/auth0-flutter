## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions).

**Why Auth0?** Because you should save time, be happy, and focus on what really matters: building your product.
