/// An interface for authenticating users using the [Auth0 Universal Login page](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login).
///
/// Authentication using Universal Login works by redirecting your user to a
/// login page hosted on Auth0's servers. To achieve this on a native device,
/// this class uses the [Auth0.Android](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android) and [Auth0.Swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) SDKs on Android and iOS/macOS respectively to
/// perform interactions with Universal Login.
///
/// It is not intended for you to instantiate this class yourself, as an
/// instance of it is already exposed as [Auth0.webAuthentication].
///
/// Usage example:
///
/// ```dart
/// final auth0 = Auth0('DOMAIN', 'CLIENT_ID');
/// final result = await auth0.webAuthentication.login();
/// final accessToken = result.accessToken;
/// ```
class WebAuthentication {
  final Account _account;
  final UserAgent _userAgent;
  final String? _scheme;
  final CredentialsManager? _credentialsManager;

  WebAuthentication(
      this._account, this._userAgent, this._scheme, this._credentialsManager);

  /// Redirects the user to the [Auth0 Universal Login page](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) for authentication. If successful, it returns
  /// a set of tokens, as well as the user's profile (constructed from ID token
  /// claims).
  ///
  /// If [redirectUrl] is not specified, a default URL is used that incorporates
  ///  the `domain` value specified to [Auth0.new], and scheme on Android, or
  /// the bundle identifier in iOS/macOS. [redirectUrl] must appear in your
  /// **Allowed Callback URLs** list for the Auth0 app.
  /// [Read more about redirecting users](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/redirect-users-after-login).
  ///
  /// How the ID token is validated can be configured using
  /// [idTokenValidationConfig], but in general the defaults for this are
  /// adequate.
  ///
  /// Additional notes:
  ///
  /// * [audience] relates to the API Identifier you want to reference in your
  /// access tokens. See [API settings](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/api-settings)
  /// to learn more.
  /// * [scopes] defaults to `openid profile email offline_access`. You can
  /// override these scopes, but `openid` is always requested regardless of this
  /// setting.
  /// * Arbitrary [parameters] can be specified and then picked up in a custom
  /// Auth0 [Action](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions) or
  /// [Rule](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/rules).
  /// * If you want to log into a specific organization, provide the
  /// [organizationId]. Provide [invitationUrl] if a user has been invited
  /// to join an organization.
  /// * (iOS only): [safariViewController] causes [`SFSafariViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller)
  /// to be used when opening the Universal Login page, as an alternative to the
  /// default `ASWebAuthenticationSession`. You will also need to
  /// [configure your iOS app to automatically resume](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-flutter/blob/main/auth0_flutter/FAQ.md#use-sfsafariviewcontroller)
  /// the Web Auth operation after login.
  /// * (iOS/macOS only): [useHTTPS] controls whether to use `https` as the
  /// scheme for the redirect URL on iOS 17.4+ and macOS 14.4+. When set to
  /// `true`, the bundle identifier of the app will be used as a custom scheme
  /// on older versions of iOS and macOS. Requires an Associated Domain
  /// configured with the `webcredentials` service type, set to your Auth0
  /// domain –or custom domain, if you have one.
  /// * (iOS/macOS only): [useEphemeralSession] controls whether shared persistent
  /// storage is used for cookies. [Read more on the effects this setting has](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-flutter/blob/main/auth0_flutter/FAQ.md#2-how-can-i-disable-the-ios-login-alert-box).
