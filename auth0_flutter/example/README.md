# Auth0 Flutter SDK: Example

Flutter app for Android, iOS, macOS, and the web that demonstrates how to use the Auth0 Flutter SDK.

## Configuration

### 1. Configure Auth0 Application

#### üì± Mobile/Desktop

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and configure the following URLs under the **Application URIs** section of the **Settings** page, for both **Allowed Callback URLs** and **Allowed Logout URLs**:

- Android: `SCHEME://YOUR_DOMAIN/android/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/callback`
- iOS: `YOUR_BUNDLE_ID://YOUR_DOMAIN/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_ID/callback`
- macOS: `YOUR_BUNDLE_ID://YOUR_DOMAIN/macos/YOUR_BUNDLE_ID/callback`

If you are using a¬†[Custom Domain](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains), replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with the value of your Custom Domain instead of the value from the settings page.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

If your Auth0 domain was `company.us.auth0.com` and your package name (Android) or bundle ID (iOS/macOS) was `com.company.myapp`, then these values would be:

- Android: `https://company.us.auth0.com/android/com.company.myapp/callback`
- iOS: `com.company.myapp://company.us.auth0.com/ios/com.company.myapp/callback`
- macOS: `com.company.myapp://company.us.auth0.com/macos/com.company.myapp/callback`

</details>

Take note of the **client ID** and **domain** values under the **Basic Information** section. You'll need these values in the next step.

#### üåê Web

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and configure the following URLs under the **Application URIs** section of the **Settings** page:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000`

Take note of the **client ID** and **domain** values under the **Basic Information** section. You'll need these values in the next step.

### 2. Configure the Flutter app

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`. Then, open it and fill in the values:

- `AUTH0_DOMAIN`: your Auth0 domain, for example `company.us.auth0.com`
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: the client ID of your Auth0 application

### 3. Configure the Android project

Copy the `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml.example` file into a new file called `strings.xml` in the same folder. This new file is ignored by Git.

Then, open the `strings.xml` file and replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with your own value ‚Äìfor instance, `company.us.auth0.com`. This value will be passed to the respective manifest placeholder.

If you prefer to use a custom scheme, configure the `com_auth0_scheme` entry with the correct value.

### 4. Run the app

Use the [Flutter CLI's](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli) `run` command.

#### üì± Mobile/Desktop

```sh
flutter run
```

#### üåê Web

```sh
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML identity provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [JSON web tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions).

**Why Auth0?** Because you should save time, be happy, and focus on what really matters: building your product.
