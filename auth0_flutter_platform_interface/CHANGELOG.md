## [1.0.1](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-flutter/tree/1.0.1) (2022-08-25)

This is the General Availability release of the **Auth0 Flutter SDK**! üéâ

This release marks the first stable release of the SDK and is fully supported for use in production environments.

## :warning: Breaking changes

There are a small number of breaking changes from `1.0.0-fa.0` in this release:

**Renamed properties**
The following properties were renamed to comply with [Dart's API guidelines](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style#do-capitalize-acronyms-and-abbreviations-longer-than-two-letters-like-words).

See #146

- `UserProfile.profileURL` to `UserProfile.profileUrl`
- `UserProfile.pictureURL` to `UserProfile.pictureUrl`
- `UserProfile.websiteURL` to `UserProfile.websiteUrl`
- `ApiException.isInvalidAuthorizeURL` to `ApiException.isInvalidAuthorizeUrl`
- `ApiException.isPKCENotAvailable` to `ApiException.isPkceNotAvailable`

**Scheme registration**

The `scheme` option of `webAuthentication().login` and `webAuthentication().logout()` was moved up a level to become an option of `webAuthentication()` instead.

Before:

```dart
auth0.webAuthentication().login(scheme: 'custom-scheme');
auth0.webAuthentication().logout(scheme: 'custom-scheme');
```

After:

```dart
auth0.webAuthentication(scheme: 'custom-scheme').login();
auth0.webAuthentication(scheme: 'custom-scheme').logout();
```

See #150

**Renamed `LocalAuthenticationOptions`**

`LocalAuthenticationOptions` was renamed to `LocalAuthentication` to fix up some confusion about how the class was to be used.

See #152 for details.

## [1.0.0-fa.0](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-flutter/tree/1.0.0-fa.0) (2022-07-21)
